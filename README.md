# dsa-exercises

Practice space for data structure and algorithm (DSA) exercises and courses.

I formally learned DSA concepts within multiple BS/MS college courses. In addition, I accumulated practical experience studying, implementing, and working with various DSA during my 17 years as a Network Scientist. This repository contains some refreshers after a seven year hiatus from the industry.
