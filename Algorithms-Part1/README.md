# Algorithms-Part1

C++ implementation of the data structures and algorithms taught in [Princeton University's Algorithms, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) course found on [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

## Why C++?

The [Algorithms, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) course uses the Java programming language to teach and analyze data structures and algorithms. All programming assignments are expected to be coded in Java as well. My exposre to the Java programming language, however, is not extenstive. I really wanted to focus on the DSA content and not my coding skills, or lack thereof. Thus my use of C++.

The bulk of my coding experience has centered around C/C++, and it is definitely my language of strength. Using C++ for the programming exercises allows me to fully focus on the performance, intracacies, and analysis of the data structures and algorithms specifically, rather than the learning and mastering of a particular coding language.

In the event that I decide to really learn and strengthen my Java coding skills, reimplementing these programming exercises in Java would be a good task.
