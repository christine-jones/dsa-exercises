# Collinear Points

C++ implementation of the programming exercise in **Module 6, Mergesort** of the [Princeton University's Algorithms, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) course on [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

# Problem Statement

This [specification](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear/specification.php) describes the programming assignment and requirements. A brief description is excerpted here.

> Write a program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points.

# Solution

# Building/Running the Code

- Clone the repository with ```git clone https://github.com/christine-jones/dsa-excercises.git```.
- Move to the directory ```dsa-exercises/Algorithms-Part1/Collinear``` and issue the command ```make```. If you wish to use a different compiler, then edit the given ```Makefile``` or import the source files into your favorite IDE.
- Issue the command ```make clean``` to remove all generated build files and the client executable.
- To run the client program: ```./collinear input-file```
  ```
  Usage: <program name> <input_file>
        input_file = file that contains input data
  ```
