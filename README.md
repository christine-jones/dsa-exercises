# dsa-exercises

Practice space for data structure and algorithm (DSA) exercises and courses.

I formally learned DSA concepts within multiple BS/MS college courses. In addition, I accumulated much practical experience studying, implementing, and working with various DSA during my 17 years as a Network Scientist. This repository contains my efforts to refamiliarize myself with data structures and algorithms after a seven year hiatus from the industry, and ongoing work to continuously build and strengthen my skills.
