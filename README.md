# dsa-exercises

Practice space for data structure and algorithm (DSA) exercises and courses.

I formally learned DSA concepts within multiple BS/MS college courses. In addition, I accumulated much practical experience studying, implementing, and working with various DSA during my 17 years as a Network Scientist. This repository contains my efforts to strengthen my understanding of data structures and algorithms after a seven year hiatus from the industry, and ongoing work to continuously build my skills as all good programmers should.

# Algorithms-Part1

Implementation of the data structures and algorithms taught in [Princeton University's Algorithms, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) course found on [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).
